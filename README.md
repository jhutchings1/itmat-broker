# The IDEAFast Feasibility Portal

## Usage

The project is meant to be used as part of a Docker/Kubernetes container deployment. At present these container are not yet published and we invite you to look at the developer setup below.

## Local development

### Requirements

First things first, there's always something before you can start.

To make our life easier, we use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) a lot. Make sure you have it installed.

### Start the project

Building the library is easy. First run `yarn install && yarn start`, to build the application. The current application is built ontop of a system Imperial College London's Data Science Institute called [ITMAT Broker](https://github.com/dsi-icl/itmat-broker) comprised of multiple components including :

- itmat-commons
- itmat-interface
- itmat-job-executor
- itmat-ui-react
- itmat-utils

### Start one item at a time

There are scripts to start the `interface`, the `job-executor` and the `ui-react` separatly; just use `yarn start:[component]` to do it.
